# Dotfiles

This repository is made so I have starter files for Linux systems.

## Vim and Vundle

The plugins include [Vim-Colored-Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) for the color scheme, and [Vim Airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) for the improver, both creating a more detailed experiance with better colors.

### How to install

Run the following command in a Linux Terminal to install the `.vimrc` file and needed files.

```
bash install.sh
```
**That's literally it** 

At of the time of writing this, `install.sh` is capable of installing Vundle and `.vimrc` as well as applying the contents of `.vimrc` to Vim.
